%A baseline front--end client that allow for the simple functionality(fuel consumption, driving patterns, possible API extension to cooperation with fuel companies to determine price for a route, maintenance status.)

\subsection{More Services}
%More services??
\subsection{Stakeholder Specifics}
%In order to truly derive what future work can be done getting a stakeholder would be step one (i.e. some company that would use the system)
%Expand support to more vehicles, what does this truly mean, do we even have vehicle specific things at this moment? would it be to produce more services?
%Are we even specific at this moment, or would vehicle specific data be things to add?(Capacity for trucks perhaps or similar attributes)
%Danish military logistics division responded to email, expand with security focus in mind. This might require some hardware to handle security issues with OBD hardware.
\subsection{Long polling}
During the development we have been mostly focusing on services, and having the
minimal viable configuration to serve our consumer and provider. To expand on
the waypoint and route service, it would be useful for the consumer client to
have support for some event notification system. The easiest to implement, and
the only one with support in JAX-RS, is long polling. Long polling involves
having the server hold a connection open, until some event occurs, at that time
the server will return the event and close the connection. JAX-RS, and RESTEasy,
support long polling, or what they call ``asynchronous responses'', with the
\code{@Suspended} annotation. We did experiment with the feature, but found
a bug with the implementation which we have reported
upstream\footnote{\url{https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RESTEASY-1225?_sscc=t}}.
