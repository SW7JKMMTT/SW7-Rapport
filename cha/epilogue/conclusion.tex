%Discussion
NoSQL for scalability?
Less restrictions for more performance
NoSQL vs. MySQL
Hibernate OGM less mature than Hibernate ORM
Review?
No stakeholder?
Truck focus? have this given us anything? at all???
Would another focus have changed anything? Mili - security // All theoretical as we have no Stakeholder -- No coz we dont have anything specific, would mostly have been front--end changes, but the front--end is PoC anyway so no big deal
Could have had stakeholder how would this have affected? would that have been the better choice?
%Conclusion
Problem statement fulfillment?
How can a scalable backâ€“end service be designed and implemented, such that geospatial
and vehicle data can be collected and aggregated in a timely way from a disjoint fleet
of vehicles, while maintaining arbitrary possibilities of presenting the data to a given user?

Scalability is our source of complexity and should be an intergral part of the conclusion
