%Meta introduction to choice of project focus
The goal for this project was to construct a scalable system that could receive geospatial and vehicle relevant data from a disjoint vehicle fleet and present this data to an arbitrary user.
Through our analysis of existing systems we found that current systems on the market revealed very little information to potential users before buying their software.
Through our initial analysis of how a system may be constructed we knew that constructing a complete system with data provider, server and front--end client was not feasible.
With our newfound information about the market focusing on developing a server which could receive data from a data provider and present this data to a front--end client through an API, would allow a company to develop their own front--end client to suit their exact needs rather than invest in a system with insufficient or redundant features.
With our newfound focus we created the list of requirements detailed in \cref{sec:requirements}.
The server we have developed uses a client--server architecture with the server providing a REST API for clients, both data providers and front--end, to communicate with.

%Discussion --- Make these segments into sections rather than just split them under the same chap?
    %NoSQL for scalability?open
    %Less restrictions for more performance
    %nosql less rigid so maintenance is easier
    %NoSQL vs. MySQL
    %Hibernate OGM less mature than Hibernate ORM
    %Test Focus, twas it value?
    %No stakeholder?
    %Truck focus? have this given us anything? at all???
    %Would another focus have changed anything? Mili - security // All theoretical as we have no Stakeholder -- No coz we dont have anything specific, would mostly have been front--end changes, but the front--end is PoC anyway so no big deal
    %Could have had stakeholder how would this have affected? would that have been the better choice?
The client--server architecture in combination with a REST API was chosen such that the server only relies on the clients using the endpoints correctly, this way the implementation of any client is completely irrelevant for the server.\fxnote{Kunne eventuelt stille op imod andre arkitekturer her, kan bare ikke lige komme paa nogle arkitekture som ville vaere relevante at stille op imod.}
We put a high priority on scalability 
%Conclusion
    %Problem statement fulfillment?
    %How can a scalable backâ€“end service be designed and implemented, such that geospatial
    %and vehicle data can be collected and aggregated in a timely way from a disjoint fleet
    %of vehicles, while maintaining arbitrary possibilities of presenting the data to a given user?

    %Test outcome? was it worth?
    %Scalability is our source of complexity and should be an intergral part of the conclusion
