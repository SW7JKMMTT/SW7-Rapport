Just notes for now.

Areas of interest
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pro: Hard split for parallel development of consumer and back--end provided us with a ``user'' who had some needs for the back--end in regard to services required. Also proves feature scalability!
    \item Con: Scheduling
    \item Intended method compared to reality.(how we failed at scrum)
    \item Con: Miniprojects
    \item Exponential work
    \item Pro: Code-review, helped particularly for exponential work as it gave less time for iterations
    \item Pro: Focus on testing for code-base, 50+\% of code is test.
    \item Pro: Testing beyond testing the code -  data provider(Sass efforts) - Load test/system test
    \item Continous integration > Gains?
\end{itemize}

Possible section setup
\section{The Planned Development Process}
%Meta shit%
6th semester experience, All-in Scrum, Phab, Code-review
\subsection{Process Plan}
Scrum Plans, Dailyscrum/scrumboard
\subsection{Process Reality}
Scrum? Not. Daily scrum, 2 times a week at best. Scheduling issues, 1.5 - 2 days a week for majority, Hours available graph?
Realizing we need to work weekends4graph.
Phab workflow, Review process
Test focused development, review+test relly handy with exponential workload as several iterations would block too much
\section{Process Reflection}
Code-review perks, hard to get stuff through but for the most part we barely have to go back once it's in master.
The effect of exponential workload and miniprojects.
Would have had a less of an effect if our project used parts of miniprojects.
