\subsection{Unit Testing}
For this i want to know
\begin{itemize}
    \item Why are we testing, and using these tests specifically?
    \item What are we testing for? what is the gain?
    \item Throw me some numbers, how is our test coverage? why are some things not tested?
    \item What is the result of our tests? how does it help us?
\end{itemize}
