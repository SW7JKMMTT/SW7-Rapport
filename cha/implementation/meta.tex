\chapter{Implementing our System}
In this part we discuss the implementation of our vehicle fleet management system, and its three main parts; the server, the producer clients, and the consumer clients.
We mainly focus on the implementation of the server, the most critical component of our system, as described in \cref{sec:constituents_of_the_system}.

The level of implementation of each component will be:

\begin{description}
    \item[Producer Clients]\hfill\\
        Will be implemented as a mock producer client, such that we can submit realistic data to the server.
    \item[Server]\hfill\\
        Will be fully implemented as this component is the main focus of this project.
    \item[Consumer Clients]\hfill\\
        Will be implemented as a proof of concept and thus will not be tested, since it merely serves the purpose of visualizing the data gathered by the server.
\end{description}

\bigskip
Each component will be represented as a chapter, and contain implementation details with code examples.
Moreover the server implementation will contain a presentation of the technology stack and a comprehensive section regarding testing.
