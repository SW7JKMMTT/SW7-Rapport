\subsection{jQuery}\label{ssec:jquery}
jQuery is one of the most used JavaScript libraries on the Internet, and is according to \textit{builtwith.com} used on up to 18.4 \% of all websites as of December 2016.\cite{buildwith}
jQuery makes it possible to manipulate and traverse HTML documents, and makes \ac{AJAX} calls through JavaScript relatively easy.
It also makes it easier to register events and make animations, than regular JavaScript, which makes the jQuery library useful for general web development.
jQuery has an internal API which is easy to use, is multi browser compatible, and all this is boiled down to a small and fast package.
Since jQuery is a JavaScript library it is only able to execute its code on the client--side, so its efficiency depends on the user's system.
jQuery is designed to work with \ac{DOM} elements, in order for it to manipulate with HTML page itself.
