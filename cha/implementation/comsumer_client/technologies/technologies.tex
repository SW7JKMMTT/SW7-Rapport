In order to construct the consumer client, and overview of the different technologies, which could be used in this solution, is gathered.
This is done to ensure that the consumer client uses these frameworks to the utmost advantage of these tools.
This research helps us realise the overall idea for the consumer client, instead of focusing on specific browser compatibility issues, i.e.~Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX).
The consumer client is communicating with the front-facing interface of the server, and presenting the data which it receives in such a way that the consumer can understand it.
