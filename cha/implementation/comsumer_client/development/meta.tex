\section{Development of the Consumer Client}\label{sec:DevelopmentConsumerClient}
In the planning of the consumer client, we discovered that the different parts of the client would have to communicate with different part of the Rest API.
Therefore we choose to go with Angular2 since it would allow for a modular client, these modules are called components in Angular2 and allows for different parts of the client to be developed separately.
