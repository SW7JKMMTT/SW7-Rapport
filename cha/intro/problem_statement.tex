\section{Problem Statement}

The focus of this paper will be on designing and implementing a web service which will act as the backend for various vehicle fleet management solutions.
The architectural design of the aforementioned backend will include every component from data gathering devices resident in individual vehicles, to the central system which aggregates and stores the data.
Moreover a proof of concept front end client will be made, to display certain aspects of the backends capabilities.

This is expressed by the following problem statement:

\noindent How can a backend service be designed and implemented, such that relevant data can be collected and aggregated in a timely way from a disjoint fleet of vehicles, while maintaining arbitrary possibilities of presenting the data to a given user?
