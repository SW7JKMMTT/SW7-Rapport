In this chapter a few existing fleet management solutions are examined.
Fleet management is an entire area of business which several companies are involved in and analysing all existing solutions would not be feasable.
The solutions we have chosen to examine are ranked amongst the top 20 fleet management systems by a business software review company, capterra~\cite{top20fleetmanagement}.
capterra is a website that aggregates business software, stores reviews, and ranks the solutions based on various measures.
While there certainly is a risk of reviews, and therefore the rankins, being manipulated, the relative ranking of the solutions is not important to the analysis of this project, capterra was merely used for discovery.
