\section{Terminology}

In this paper we will use some terminology which may have more than one interpretation and thusly can appear ambiguous.
In this section we will clarify these terms.

\subsection{Scale/Scalability}
% Jeg er faktisk ikke helt sikker på det her, oftest snakker man jo om vertical/horizontal om at scale over mange enhender eller scale en enhed op.
% Vi brugte det mere om at scale over mange forskelle devices (ODB).
% Antallet af enheder man understøtter findes der måske et bedre ord for?
The term scale will be used in two contexts, load scalability and device support scalability.
Load scalability regards increasing the amount of devices connecting to a service.
Normally this is separated into horizontal and vertical scaling, which is scaling across many computers or scaling across a more powerful computer, accordingly.

Device support scalability regards the ability to scale effortlessly across many different device interfaces
To achieve this one must avoid being too tightly coupled to a single (kind of) provider of information.
