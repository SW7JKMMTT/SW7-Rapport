\begin{itemize}
    \item Be able to read data from OBD and GPS off a mobile device.
    \item Have a design which allows for easy scalability of the incoming data(OBD/HDOBD) and other possible extensions or future generations of OBD.
    \item Normalize incoming data from their various format to a single format, this includes possible extension data from EOBD.
    \item Provide data in various sensible formats such that a possible client isn't forced to use our idea of a ``proper'' format.
    \item Provide any obtainable data to a possible client.
    \item Acquire useful data from sources beyond OBD?? Fuel cost based on geolocation maybe?
    \item Have scalability in regard to those measures defined earlier
\end{itemize}
