Vehicular transport is a widespread phenomenon, as such the use of fleet management systems are relied on by companies all over the globe.
We present the development of a server intended for use as a back--end for fleet management systems.

\bigskip \noindent
While an entire fleet management system encompasses a data source and a front--client aside from a back--end, we produce a back--end which provides a REST API such than an arbitrary corporation may develop their own front--end to suit their unique needs.

\bigskip \noindent
The back--end is developed with quality, scalability and reliability in mind, from these qualities emerges a heavy focus on testing, both internally and externally.
The emphasis on testing culminates a development environment with regression tests excellent for expansion due to the heavy presence of regression tests.
The advantages obtained through this are strengthened even further with a focus on modularity allowing us to adapt the API in accordance with client requirements.

\bigskip \noindent
In the pursuit of this development we utilise numerous mature and well--tested technologies such that we can focus on design aspects particular to a fleet management back--end.
